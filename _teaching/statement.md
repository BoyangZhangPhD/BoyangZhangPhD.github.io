Throughout my graduate education in four engineering disciplines
([civil &amp; environmental engineering](https://cee.duke.edu/),
[electrical &amp; computer engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/),
[mechanical engineering &amp; materials science](https://mems.duke.edu/), and
[ocean &amp; naval architectural engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/))
in the United States and Canada,
I have taught/TA-ed a total of 440 students from four disciplines
in eight different courses (two graduate courses and six undergraduate courses),
whose class sizes range from seven to 106 students.
Through those diverse teaching experiences, I have found passion in interacting with students and teaching in higher education. My ultimate teaching objectives are to
equip my students with the competency to identify, formulate, and innovatively solve engineering challenges
and to educate them to be excellent contributors to society. 

My past teaching experiences are presented as below.

As a future faculty member, I aspire to implement state-of-the-art pedagogical techniques as
well as my own research findings into my teaching to enrich the studentsâ€™ learning experience.
In order to better prepare myself, I have participated in the [Certificate in College Teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching), 
[Certificate in Teaching Writing](https://twp.duke.edu/students/graduate/certificate-program), 
and [Preparing Future Faculty](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/preparing-future-faculty) programs at Duke University. 
Through the CCT program, I have taken courses on the most effective instructional skills,
course design and syllabus construction, online and hybrid pedagogy, and teaching diverse learners.
Moreover, through the CCT Teaching Triangles, my teaching was observed and given feedback by
peer PhD students from biology, political science, and romance studies.

From those teaching experiences and training programs, I have gained indispensable knowledge
and skills in teaching in higher education. As a recognition, I was [**nominated for Outstanding
TA Award**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/176joML9j3vXGhrd3ddlEBBxJxWcgS3fj/view?usp=sharing) 
while at Memorial University and [**won the Bass Instructional TA Fellowship**](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/news/fellowship-snapshots-2022/), 
one of only four awardees selected from Duke PhD candidates across all years and disciplines.
