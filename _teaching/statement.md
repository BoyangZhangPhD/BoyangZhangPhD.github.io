Throughout my graduate education in four engineering disciplines
([civil &amp; environmental engineering](https://cee.duke.edu/),
[electrical &amp; computer engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/),
[mechanical engineering &amp; materials science](https://mems.duke.edu/), and
[ocean &amp; naval architectural engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/))
in the United States and Canada,
I have taught/TA-ed a total of 440 students from four disciplines
across eight distinct courses.
These courses encompassed two graduate-level and six undergraduate-level classes, 
with class sizes ranging from seven students to 106 learners.

Engaging with this diverse student body has ignited within me a profound passion in interacting with students and teaching in higher education. My overarching aim as an educator is to empower my students with the skills to identify, formulate, and innovatively solve pressing engineering challenges and to educate them to be ethical, competent, and innovative contributors to society.

My past teaching experiences are presented as below.

Reflecting on my teaching journey thus far, I am committed to continually refining my pedagogical approach by integrating cutting-edge instructional techniques and leveraging insights gleaned from my own research endeavors. To this end, I have actively pursued professional development opportunities, including the [Certificate in College Teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching), 
[Certificate in Teaching Writing](https://twp.duke.edu/students/graduate/certificate-program), 
and [Preparing Future Faculty](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/preparing-future-faculty) programs at Duke University, and the National Effective Teaching Institute (**NETI**) [Workshop on Course Design and Student Engagement](https://www.neti-workshop.org/events/category/neti-1/?mc_cid=53fe5650a6&mc_eid=438e9b213a). 

<!---
Participation in the Certificate in College Teaching program afforded me exposure to a range of pedagogical topics, including effective instructional skills, course design and syllabus construction, online and hybrid pedagogy, and approaches to teaching diverse learners. Through the program's Teaching Triangles initiative, I received valuable peer feedback on my teaching methodologies from PhD students representing varied academic disciplines, including biology, political science, and romance studies.

My dedication to teaching excellence has been recognized through an [**Outstanding
TA Award Finalist**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/176joML9j3vXGhrd3ddlEBBxJxWcgS3fj/view?usp=sharing) at Memorial University and the prestigious [**Bass Instructional TA Fellowship**](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/news/fellowship-snapshots-2022/) at Duke University, where I was selected as _one of only four_ recipients from among PhD candidates spanning all disciplines and academic years. These accolades underscore my commitment to fostering inclusive, dynamic learning environments that inspire students to excel and thrive.
