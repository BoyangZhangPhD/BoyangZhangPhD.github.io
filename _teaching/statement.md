Throughout my graduate education in four engineering disciplines
([civil &amp; environmental engineering](https://cee.duke.edu/),
[electrical &amp; computer engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/),
[mechanical engineering &amp; materials science](https://mems.duke.edu/), and
[ocean &amp; naval architectural engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/))
in the United States and Canada,
I have taught/TA-ed a total of 440 students from four disciplines
in eight different courses (two graduate courses and six undergraduate courses),
whose class sizes range from seven to 106 students.
Through those diverse teaching experiences,
I have found passion in interacting with students and teaching in higher education.  
My ultimate teaching objectives are to
equip my students with the competency to identify, formulate, and innovatively solve engineering challenges
and to educate them to be excellent contributors to society.
