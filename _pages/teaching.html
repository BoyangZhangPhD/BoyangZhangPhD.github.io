Throughout my graduate education in four engineering disciplines 
([civil & environmental engineering](https://cee.duke.edu/), 
[electrical & computer engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/), 
[mechanical engineering & materials science](https://mems.duke.edu/), and 
[ocean & naval architectural engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/)) 
in the United States and Canada, 
I have taught/TA-ed a total of 440 students from four disciplines 
in eight different courses (two graduate courses and six undergraduate courses), 
whose class sizes range from seven to 106 students. 
Through those diverse teaching experiences, 
I have found passion in interacting with students and teaching in higher education.  
My ultimate teaching objectives are to 
equip my students with the competency to identify, formulate, and innovatively solve engineering challenges 
and to educate them to be excellent contributors to society.

I consider teaching an instructor-lead, student-oriented, mutual-learning process. Throughout
my years of graduate school training, I have TA-ed/co-taught in total 438 students in seven
different courses (one graduate course and six undergraduate courses) whose class size ranges
from 15 to 106 students. In order to better prepare me as a faculty member, I have participated 
in the programs of Certificate in College Teaching (CCT), Certificate in Teaching Writing (CTW), 
and Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) at Duke University. From these training programs, I gain 
invaluable knowledge and skills in teaching in higher education. As a recognition, I was nominated 
for Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award while at Memorial University and won Bass Instructional 
Fellowship at Duke University. 

The value I treasure most throughout my past and present roles as a teacher and mentor is
the learning experience and outcome of the students. In the classroom, I try to foster a friendly
and inclusive environment for all students, particularly those who are from underrepresented
groups in higher education, to ask course-related questions. To help the students thrive in
the class, I lay out concrete fundamentals during the first portion of the course and pose
questions during lectures to raise their attention and interests. At the end of the course, students
demonstrate their grasp on the knowledge via lab and project reports, assignments, quizzes, and
exams. Outside of classroom, I attempt to be approachable and accessible for students who
have course-related or general university/job related questions. Students’ evaluations and praises
for my teaching and personality are well documented in the appended course evaluation forms.

As a future faculty scholar, I plan to implement the state-of-the-art pedagogical techniques
as well as my own research findings into my teaching to enrich the students’ learning experience.
My teaching objectives are to motivate students through hands-on labs and projects and to
encourage their participation via dynamic small group collaboration and in-class discussions. My
teaching interests span dynamics, robotics, control, and optimization. Within the department, I
am confident in teaching the following courses:
  * Undergraduate: Matrix Analysis, Solid Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, Mechanical Vibrations,
Risk Engineering;
  * Graduate: Structural Dynamics, Numerical Linear Algebra. 

Moreover, based on my research expertise and teaching interests, I aim to design the
following new courses to complement the department’s existing curricula and to consolidate the
department’s ambition on expanding the track of Dynamics and Control:
  * Undergraduate: Control Systems Design, Fundamentals in Robotics, Optimization;
  * Graduate: Nonlinear Systems, Advanced Robotics and Control

I enjoy interactions with students, and I have been nurturing the following attitudes in
students who complete course work or research with me:
  * demonstrate understanding of rigorous mathematical tools for design/analysis,
  * exhibit audience driven communication strategies through team labs and porject presentations,
  * establish sound systematical/environmental/ethical/social reasoning.

I believe that my student-centered pedagogical philosophy, rich teaching experience, and
unique research expertise can contribute to the continued growth and success of the students as
well as the department.
